Note for all alpha testers:
  please keep in mind that we are a small group of 3 coders. 2 of whom are not seniors, and none of whom have ever coded in Unity before, or had any game dev experience.  Additionally, our user story was fairly broad in scope, ambitious, and very subjective. 
  Things that may seem simple to an experienced game developer ended up taking us hours to implement and debug.



MVP: An engaging 2D side-scrolling game featuring multiple procedural or randomly generated elements.
The game will be RPG and exploration based, meaning it will include combat, monsters, loot, a leveling system, and a branching overworld.

Add-on features:  
-randomly or procedurally generated loot  
-randomly or procedurally generated tasks / quests   
-procedurally generated towns, villagers,  et c.  
-new game plus  


User story:   
As a videogame player, I want to play a game forever (or at least a very long period of time). I want that game to be an interesting and engaging 2D side-scrolling RPG game.
I want to see numbers go up, and I want to gain visible progress in terms of skills or items (or at least numbers).  
I want that progress to still be "meaningful" so I can feel good when progress causes noticeable changes in gameplay
(any of the following: previous areas are easier, certain things can be done faster, new skills or abilities, shiny new trophy)
beyond just numbers getting bigger.  
I want the game to provide a different experience each time I start over, without the randomization processing being overly transparent or too similar to all other players or previous times I played it.  


Alpha release instructions: Currently only Windows builds are available.
