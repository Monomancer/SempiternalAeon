MVP: An engaging 2 dimensional desktop game in which enough of the features are procedurally generated or randomized in such a way that it's fun to play for more than a few levels, but that is different each time and to each player. 
(Absolute minimum example: map is procedurally generated and monsters are randomized)

Add-on features:
-randomly or procedurally generated loot.
-randomly or procedurally generated tasks / quests
-procedurally generated towns, villagers,  et c.
-new game plus


User story: 
As a videogame player, I want to play a game forever (or at least a very long period of time). I want that game to be interesting and engaging, presenting new and novel content periodically.  I want to see numbers go up, and I want to gain visible progress in terms of skills or items (or at least numbers).
I want that progress to still be "meaningful" so I can feel good about it where progress causes noticable changes in gameplay
(any of the following: previous areas are easier, certain things can be done faster, new skills or abilities, shiny new trophy)
beyond just numbers increasing.
I want the game to provide a different experience each time I start over, without the randomiziation processing being overly transparent or too similar to all other players or previous times I played it.
