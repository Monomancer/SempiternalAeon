User story:   
As a videogame player, I want to play a game forever (or at least a very long period of time). I want that game to be an interesting and engaging 2D side-scrolling RPG game.
I want to see numbers go up, and I want to gain visible progress in terms of skills or items (or at least numbers).  
I want that progress to still be "meaningful" so I can feel good when progress causes noticeable changes in gameplay
(any of the following: previous areas are easier, certain things can be done faster, new skills or abilities, shiny new trophy)
beyond just numbers getting bigger.  
I want the game to provide a different experience each time I start over, without the randomization processing being overly transparent or too similar to all other players or previous times I played it.
