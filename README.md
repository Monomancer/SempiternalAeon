The game will be RPG and exploration based, meaning it will include combat, monsters, loot, a leveling system, and a branching overworld. The player will be able to kill monsters and complete quests in order to progress and become more powerful.

Add-on features:  
-randomly or procedurally generated loot  
-randomly or procedurally generated tasks / quests   
-procedurally generated towns, villagers,  etc.  
-new game plus  


User story:   
As a videogame player, I want to play a game forever (or at least a very long period of time).
I want to see numbers go up, and I want to gain visible progress in terms of skills or items (or at least numbers).  
I want that progress to still be "meaningful" so I can feel good when progress causes noticeable changes in gameplay
(any of the following: previous areas are easier, certain things can be done faster, new skills or abilities, shiny new trophy)
beyond just numbers getting bigger.  
I want the game to provide a different experience each time I start over, without the randomization processing being overly transparent or too similar to all other players or previous times I played it. I want to kill monsters, collect various items and gain experience as I go along so I can beat stronger monsters and complete more quests.
