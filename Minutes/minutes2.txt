Minutes for meeting 2

Feb 21st. 5 to 6 pm
(actually started a few minutes late because we were talking to the professor)

Attendance:
All present
Benjamin, Justin, and Andrew

Discussed:
What we completed since last time.
What we need for our prototype.
Benjamin mentioned that we needed to add gitignore files which he forgot was necessary when he created the repos.


Accomplished since the last meeting:

Benjamin:
-Realized the Unity engine would not run very well on his ultrabook which is running Gubuntu so he went through the very painful task of learning how to develop in a Windows 10 environment.
-Helped his teammates learn about .gitignore files and Github Desktop

Justin:
-Fixed the camera so it follows the character with less space on the bottom

Andrew:
-Fixed character from falling over and added basic AI

Goals for next meeting:
Benjamin:
-continue to work on a quest mechanic / interface
Andrew:
-add health/player damage/combat. Prototype leveling maybe
Justin:
-fix walking animation and add basic attack animation
